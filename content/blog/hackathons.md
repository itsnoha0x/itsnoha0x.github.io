When I asked [Yasir White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasir-white/) how he got into hackathons, he started from the beginning:

> “I always thought coding sounded cool when watching YouTube videos. I started with some small web & game development projects, and ended up finding a passion in computers. I knew I wanted to compete in computer science, so I attended Florida’s largest hackathon, ShellHacks, and it was a blast. I knew that this was going to become a regular thing after that experience.”

So what’s the story of Hackathons? And how can they be, not only a competition, but a career boost and portfolio gem?

## What is a hackathon, really?

At its core, a hackathon is a timed tech competition where individuals or teams create tech projects from scratch, for about 24 or 48 hours. It provides an opportunity for people to innovate, impress industry professionals from notable companies, and even secure jobs with emerging startups. 

I interviewed Yassir White, a computer science student and passionate hackathon organizer, to break it all down!

He believes that the greatest benefit of hackathons is for college students, looking to break into the industry. Often, the computer science curriculum is far behind the industry’s needs, and activities like hackathon competitions are the best solution!

> “By organizing HackCC, I wanted to give computer science students the chance to see their potential and achieve long-term success in their careers. When teammates hug at the end of a competition, proud of their 36-hour project, it means a lot to me that so many students have grown.”

## What actually happens at a hackathon?

While hackathon formats differ from one place to another, the process is usually similar. 

- **Team Formation & Ideation**
    
    Some show up with friends, others join team-building sessions. Then comes the process of finding your idea: brainstorming, coordinating, and making the plan of attack.
    
- **Building the Project**
    
    This is the core: hours of coding, testing, debugging, and multiple check-ins to keep up with the progress. 
    
- **Presenting to Judges**
    
    Your team prepares a pitch and demo, aiming to prove your concept and impress industry-level professionals.

## Hackathons and what they offer for developers:

It’s indeed a competition, time-based and prize-related, but even if you don’t make it to the top, the experience itself offers huge benefits:

- **Networking Opportunities**
    
    Hackathons often include sponsor booths and recruiters from well-known companies. By engaging with them, you get valuable exposure that can lead to mentorships, internships, or even job offers.
    
- **Building Meaningful Connections**
    
    You might be matched with strangers, but you leave as teammates, and sometimes future co-founders or lifelong friends. Hackathons are great for forming strong professional bonds.
    
- **Sharpening Technical Skills**
    
    Every hackathon challenges your core skill set. Whether you’re into front-end, AI, hardware, or cybersecurity, you’ll get the chance to build fast, learn tools, and solve real problems on the fly.
    
- **Mastering Communication & Presentation**
    
    Beyond the code, you’ll need to pitch your project clearly to judges. That means structuring your ideas, confidently speaking in front of an audience, and answering tough questions—skills you’ll use for the rest of your career.

## Advice for first-timers:

> “For people who are on edge about participating, attend one! It is a life-altering experience worth having. Don’t worry about your skills; most of these things are catered to beginners. The most important piece of advice is to go in with an open mind and have fun, you’ll enjoy the ride a lot more when you’re less serious about it.”

Personally, I’ve never joined one (*yet*) — but writing this made me excited. You’ll definitely hear about it when I attend my first hackathon.

## And for now,

I leave you with the motivational boost you needed to look for opportunities like this! It’s not always about coding classes and serious graded projects. Sometimes it’s about laughing it out, working on a silly idea on a hackathon night with a bunch of people who might become your best friends!
