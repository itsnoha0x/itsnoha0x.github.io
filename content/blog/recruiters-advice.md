I’ve been a cybersecurity student for a while now, and one question never leaves my mind: *How do we get hired?*

People in the field start thinking about getting hired early on, the skills needed, the best certificates, and how to meet all requirements… so I was wondering about the other end too! 

How do recruiters think? What makes them choose one CV over the other? What are the hiring secrets that WE don’t know?

I'm glad that I’ve met a recruiter on my way, who can give us all the answers. [Mr. Musa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/musa-ayoob/) is a tech and cybersecurity recruiter with over 10 years of experience supporting companies across the UK and beyond. 

His work with a wide range of businesses enabled him to place everyone from entry-level analysts to CISOs, and he developed a genuine passion for guiding people into meaningful careers within cybersecurity.

This perfectly fitting profile is how he’s helping us today build the foundation we need. With practical advice on how to get you hired in cybersecurity with no pain.

## Why Cybersecurity? Why now?

Cybersecurity is not just a trend. It’s one of the fastest-growing fields in tech!

According to [MoneyZine](https://moneyzine.com/careers/cybersecurity-job-statistics/), the global cybersecurity industry had nearly 4.7 million employees in 2022, and 62% of companies say their cybersecurity teams are understaffed. That makes it a field of opportunities and growth.

Day after day, companies of all sizes need a security team and services to protect their infrastructures.

On the other hand, getting hired is NOT just about what you know, but also how you present and demonstrate your skills. This article gives you the recruiter's perspective, so you can stop guessing and start moving forward with clarity.

## What do recruiters look for in a cybersecurity candidate?

As the field grows, the quantity of candidates often outweighs the quality, making it harder to stand out. So Mr. Musa answers:

> Companies are often looking for curiosity, a willingness to learn, and a solid grasp of the fundamentals. Soft skills like communication and problem-solving are just as important, particularly in GRC or awareness-based roles.
> 

A recruiter’s attention is caught by passion, clarity, and relevance. It’s especially valuable when a candidate takes time to tailor their CV and highlight their hands-on experience. Projects like home labs, volunteering, or explaining why they want to work in [cybersecurity](https://nohawrites.com/blog/how-to-break-into-cybersecurity/) make them stand out immediately.

And as our guest mentioned, the skills needed are diversified from technical to human:

- Technical skills: like networking, risk management, basic security controls, [operating systems](https://nohawrites.com/blog/simple-guide-to-windows-vs-linux/), and cloud platforms
- Soft skills: like communication, adaptability, a growth mindset, and a continuous willingness to learn

So don’t be the learner who rushes into hacking and skips the foundational tech knowledge. Start with the basics and make sure you grasp how things work before securing them.

Also, don’t overlook communication and personal presentation; they are key to making a strong impression and showcasing your knowledge.

## What does the hiring process look like?

Getting hired is a two-way process. To improve your chances, you’d better understand HOW recruiters make their decisions.

> It usually starts with a CV review, followed by an informal screening call. From there, strong candidates are shortlisted and passed to the hiring manager. Many organizations also use technical interviews, assessments, or scenario-based questions to gauge problem-solving ability and understanding.
> 

This gives you, as a job seeker, insight into what to focus on and how to communicate effectively with recruiters and hiring managers. You pay attention to your CV, the way you talk in the first call, the first information you present, and how you prove your skills and knowledge.

With so many people chasing their cybersecurity dream path, it becomes a bit tricky to start, especially in a room full of experts, top hackers, and talented fellows who know how to play their cards right.

This leads us to the next direct question:

## How to get your very first job:

### Build your knowledge:

It may sound obvious, but cybersecurity jobs require real, practical knowledge and consistent, long-term effort.

Start small, build real projects, certify your basics, and grow your confidence.

> Certifications are helpful, especially entry-level ones like **CompTIA Security+** or **ISC2** Certified in Cybersecurity. However, self learning is just as valuable.
> 

If you're wondering where to begin professionally, here are some solid entry-level roles that make great starting points in cybersecurity:

- SOC analyst (Security Operations Center)
- Junior GRC analyst
- Risk, compliance, and third-party risk analyst
- IT support with a security focus
- Cybersecurity awareness training

And from there, you can explore the rest of the field with more confidence.

### Make your CV work for you:

Alongside our interaction, Mr. Musa has previously done a workshop about CVs, addressing the common issues he often sees:

- **Clarity is key:** Keep your wording clear, well-structured, and your CV easy to scan. Recruiters are busy and have tons of applications to check
- **Back up what you claim:** Whenever you mention a skill, show how you’ve used it in real life. Be prepared with evidence of hands-on practice.
- **Tailor to the job:** Avoid being generic or vague, and do your full research on the role and company.
- **Show your difference:** Highlight your special achievements, even little projects or wins. Any detail is appreciated to set you apart from competitors
- **Stay human:** Don’t act like a robot, be simple, honest, and show genuine enthusiasm

Remember that a great CV’s purpose is to make a good impression and get you to the interview stage. It’s your entry ticket, with how you present your value.

### Present your skills properly:

Recruiters don’t know your story. It’s your job to show the effort, present yourself, and what you can do.

To do so, use real examples. Whether it is a virtual lab, a project you contributed to, or even a detailed write-up of how you fixed a security issue, it is all valuable. Make it easy for hiring managers to see what you have done and how it relates to the role.

Mention any internships you’ve done, and what you’ve learned from them. If you haven’t had one, focus on volunteering, participating in CTFs, or contributing to open-source projects.

### Even if you’re in transition, you’re needed:

Tech has always welcomed people in transition. Every day, someone from a non-technical background breaks into the field, one video a day, one lab at a time.

As Mr. Musa told me, he has worked with teachers, project managers, ex-military professionals, and more who have successfully transitioned. And one story stood out:

> I once worked with a candidate who came from a hospitality background and had no formal IT experience. He built a small home lab, volunteered to help a local charity improve their IT security, and documented everything. His passion and initiative were enough to land him his first SOC role. Today, he is a senior analyst mentoring others. Stories like that are why I love this job.
> 

This isn’t the first or last; it’s a pattern. Trust yourself and work with what you already have to leverage. With strengths like process management and analytical thinking, you’ll definitely find your deserved place in cybersecurity. 

## Final thought

Cybersecurity is full of opportunities, but too many great candidates miss out because they don’t understand what recruiters look for.

Now you know.

And as Mr. Musa said:

> Stay curious, stay consistent, and do not be afraid to ask for help. Find a mentor if you can, get involved in local or online communities, and keep learning. There is space in cybersecurity for people from all walks of life.
